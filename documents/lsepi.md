NOTE: make sure you put the references part in the references section (just bellow the LSPI stuff)

**GDPR**
GDPR is an important part of this program as the data we will be handling is some very important data. While we wont be dealing with payment info (it will be outsourced) the details of a rent agreement along with their documents are some very important bits of personal data and we will need to protect them. Specific bits of data include: location, rent cost, rent payment details. As you can see in #2, Google had issues with GDPR, more specifically in their ad targeting and was fined heavily in retaliation.

**Accessibility**
Rent isnâ€™t just for the average person, everyone needs a place to live and so people with accessibility issues are a very real part of the userbase. Ensuring those with needs for some extra help are catered for is an important part of this project and as such we will need to pay attention to the accessibility of the project. The main way we will be doing this is through the Lighthouse tool, which lets you evaluate the accessibility of a site against 4 different criteria: Performance, Accessibility, Best practices and SEO. This part is especially important as other companies with less impact relating to accessibility have been sued for similar things (as seen in #3).

**Tenancy agreements**
The tenancy agreements are a tricky topic because they involve a lot of different parts and can heavily vary between each instance of renting, the main thing we have to pay attention too is the length of storage which according to my sources (#1) only needs to be held for the length of the agreement, though it will be good practice to keep the documents for a couple extra years to allow landlords to access the documents after the tenancy ends.
